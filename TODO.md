# TODO

Look, we all know these probably won't get done, but here's a list anyway.

## High Priority

-   [ ] Add TypeScript support (because apparently JavaScript isn't good enough
        anymore)
-   [ ] Add tests (yes, we should probably have those)
-   [ ] Add Docker support (because containerization is cool or something)
-   [ ] Add database integration examples (SQL? NoSQL? Yes?)
-   [ ] Add proper logging system (console.log doesn't count)

## Medium Priority

-   [ ] Add more example commands
    -   [ ] Moderation commands (for power-tripping admins)
    -   [ ] Fun commands (for people who think bots are toys)
    -   [ ] Utility commands (for people who actually use bots properly)
-   [ ] Add command categories system
-   [ ] Add permission system examples
-   [ ] Add cooldown system examples
-   [ ] Add rate limiting examples (because spam is bad)

## Low Priority

-   [ ] Add documentation (that nobody will read)
-   [ ] Add JSDoc comments (because we're pretending to be professional)
-   [ ] Add more code examples
-   [ ] Add performance optimization guide
-   [ ] Add deployment guides
    -   [ ] Heroku
    -   [ ] DigitalOcean
    -   [ ] AWS
    -   [ ] Your mom's laptop

## Would Be Nice

-   [ ] Add a GUI for configuration (because clicking is easier than typing)
-   [ ] Add a web dashboard (because everyone loves those)
-   [ ] Add analytics (to see how nobody uses your bot)
-   [ ] Add multi-language support (for people who don't speak American)
-   [ ] Add voice command examples (because typing is so 2020)

## Probably Never

-   [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
-   [ ] Add 100% test coverage
-   [ ] Make it bug-free
-   [ ] Get people to actually read the README
-   [ ] Achieve world peace

## Done âœ“

-   [x] Create basic template
-   [x] Add slash command support
-   [x] Add basic error handling
-   [x] Add environment variable support
-   [x] Add development/production modes
-   [x] Write this TODO list

## Notes

-   Priority levels are more like suggestions
-   Items may be completed out of order
-   Some items may never be completed
-   New items may be added
-   Old items may be forgotten
-   Such is life
